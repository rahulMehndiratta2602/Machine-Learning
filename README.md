# Machine-Learning
Contains Python code from scratch for machine learning Classification Agorithms

This repository contains python from scratch implementation of 6 ML classification algorithms without using ML libraries like sklearn and only using python libraries like numpy and pandas namely:
1) Fisher Linear Discriminant
2) Linear Regression
3) Linear Perceptron
4) Support Vector Machine
5) Naives Bayes Classifier
6) Artificial Neural Networks
Finally There is a jupyter notebook in Combined Sklearn Folder which is the ML implementation of The above 6 classification algorithms on dataset_comb.csv and there is a comparision of their accuracies in a box plot
